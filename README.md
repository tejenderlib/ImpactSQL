# Global Disaster Impact Analysis

A data analytics project focused on analyzing global disaster trends, human impact, and economic losses using SQL and interactive dashboards.

---

## Overview

This project transforms raw disaster data into structured insights to understand how disasters impact different regions across the world.

It demonstrates:

* Data cleaning and transformation using SQL
* Analytical querying on real-world data
* Dashboard development for insight-driven analysis

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

To ensure accurate and reliable analysis, the raw dataset was transformed into a structured, analysis-ready format through the following steps:

* Converted key fields from text to numeric types (`total_deaths`, `total_affected`, `total_damage_usd`)
* Normalized economic damage values from `'000 US$` to standard USD
* Standardized column names to a consistent `snake_case` format
* Extracted and created a dedicated `year` column for time-based analysis
* Handled missing and null values in critical fields to prevent aggregation errors
* Cleaned and aligned geographic data (`country`, `location`) for accurate mapping
* Created derived fields (e.g., combined location for map visualization) to improve geospatial accuracy
* Ensured consistent data formatting across all records for reliable grouping and filtering


## Key Insights

* Disaster impact is concentrated in specific high-risk regions
* Earthquakes contribute significantly to total fatalities
* Economic losses reach trillions of USD globally
* Disaster frequency shows an increasing trend over time


## Tech Stack

* MySQL
* SQL
* Google Looker Studio
* CSV
